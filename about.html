  <h2>
    How do you make a map in Fortnite Creative?
  </h2>
  <p>
    A lot of people ask the question "How do you start a creative map?" Or "How do you make a battle royale map?" and we know that a lot of people want help with terrain and other things so thats where we will come in! We are here to help and teach you guys a lot about terrain! This will start soon...
  </p>
  <h2>
    How do you have fun?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The way we have fun making the maps is by play testing witb friends and adding stuff that we think will be fun, and it can take a lot to stay motivated sometimes but with the motivation and time, you can make something awsome!
