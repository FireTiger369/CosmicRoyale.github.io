    The Big Boom: Update Patch Notes
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
    This update adds a lot of new things and one of them is the war beginning to pick up and get close to someone winning!
    <p>
      <h2>
        New Mechanics
  </h2>
  <p>
    One new mechanic added this update is the drones... we don't know who owns these drones but we are going to think its a new faction and we think this war may be coming to a end all though before that, we must fix time! We are going to active the device soon... stay tuned for updates!
  </p>
  <h2>
    New weapons
  </h2>
  <p>
    Inside the drones are some new loot and its advenced as there is a pulse rifle and a jetpack? There is a lot to see in the drones and to check out before the new season and this is the biggest update for the season as we have to end it with a bang...
  </p>
  <h2>
    New Locations
    </h2>
  <p>
    The drones have arrived on the map and we must take them down after we get the device and fix time! Please help us in this war... or join there side and get wrecked by us, your choice. There is also new outposts? Who are those from?
